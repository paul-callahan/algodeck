# Anki

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a free software (Windows/Mac/Linux/iPhone/Android) designed to help remembering information. Anki relies on the concept of **spaced repetition** which is a proven technique to increase the rate of memorization. Here's a 2-minute video that delves into spaced repetition:

!!! quote "Michael A. Nielsen, "Augmenting Long-term Memory""

    The single biggest change that Anki brings about is that it means memory is no longer a haphazard event, to be left to chance. Rather, it guarantees I will remember something, with minimal effort. That is, Anki makes memory a choice.

I used Anki myself with [Algo Deck](index.md) and [Design Deck](designdeck.md) and it paid off. This method played a key role in helping me land a role as **L5 SWE at Google** (senior software engineer).

Here is a flashcard example:
